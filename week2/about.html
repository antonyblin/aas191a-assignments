                    <p>my name is antony, and i'm a second-year anthropology major at ucla, but i'll be graduating early this quarter (yay &#128528; )! i was born in san jose, ca, but i've also lived in sacramento and san diego (both in ca still). my new obssession is this chocolate avocado vegan ice cream from costco; i haven't had anything that good in like - a few weeks. k-pop and anime have been two really big parts of my life since i was super young, and i never thought i would let this secret see the light of day, but in my freshman year of high school, i watched about 800 episodes of one piece in less than a month (not to mention all the other anime of the season). i'm an avid walker, and i've even walked all the way from ucla to k-town and back.<br/><br/>since it's my last quarter, i decided to take all of the courses i thought sounded interesting:</p>

                    </ol>
                    <p>oh yeah, i'm also taking this class? idk, the professor is kinda weird about puns (don't tell him i said that)...</p>
